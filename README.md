## Introduction
Diamonds have long been prized for their beauty, rarity, and value. However, determining the price of a diamond can be a complex task influenced by various factors such as carat weight, cut, color, and clarity. This project aims to simplify the process by using machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics.

## Features
- **Diamond Price Prediction:** The core feature of this application is the ability to predict the price of a diamond based on its features, such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and more. By leveraging historical data and machine learning models, the application provides accurate price estimates.

- **Data Analysis:** In addition to predicting diamond prices, this project offers data analysis capabilities. You can explore the dataset, visualize relationships between different features, and gain insights into how various factors impact diamond prices.

- **Model Evaluation:** The project includes a comprehensive evaluation of different machine learning models. You can compare the performance of various algorithms and choose the one that best suits your needs.
